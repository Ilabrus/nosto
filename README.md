The Assignment - Java Currency Convertor
Create a RESTful API which receives it will get three inputs:

A source currency
A target currency
A monetary value

The API must leverage the exchange rates provided at https://exchangeratesapi.io/ to return a converted value (please note their free plan will be more than enough to create your API). So if your input is 30, USD and GBP, you would need to return the calculated result.

Expose your logic behind a RESTful API
The API has to be written in Java. Feel free to use a framework of your choice.
Treat the backend as you would develop actual production software.
We want to see and test your API, so make the code available to us together with the link to the Git repository.
Deploy your application to a hosted service such as Heroku or Amazon Lambda

Not to make this open to interpretation, treat as bad input everything that is not in the list of supported currencies on the site.
